# Identifying Cassini Bow-Shock Crossings Using a Basic Sequential Neural Network

Cassini is the spacecraft that was deployed to orbit saturn between 1997 and 2017. Using the magnetometer data, I was a able to determine whether or not Cassini crossed Saturn's magnetic field boundary (the Bow-Shock) using machine learning.
